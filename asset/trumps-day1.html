      <h1 class="font-bold sm:text-6xl text-[28px] py-4 sm:py-6">What has Donald Trump promised to do on day one of his second term?</h1>
      <h2 class="font-italics text-2xl text-gray-400">The US president-elect takes office on January 20, after a campaign that featured dozens of promises of executive action.</h2>
          <div>
            <img src="./images/trump-day.webp" class="w-[100%] my-4">
          </div>
      <p class="py-2 max-w-4xl sm:text-xl text-base">Washington, DC – United States President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to be a dictator – but only on “day one” of his upcoming term.

      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">That was the statement Trump gave to Fox News in December 2023, in the midst of his most recent campaign for re-election.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Sitting at a town hall with host Sean Hannity, Trump used a question about whether he would abuse presidential power to pivot to his long list of day-one priorities.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">“I love this guy,” Trump told the audience, gesturing to Hannity. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said, ‘No, no, no, other than day one. We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling’.”
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Since then, Trump’s promises for his first day in office have only grown, spanning questions on immigration to redesigning the federal government.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">On Monday, Trump takes the oath of office, following a stunning political comeback in November’s elections.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">The swearing-in ceremony will officially kick off his second term as president. And all eyes are on how he will wield his authority once back in the White House.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Trump is expected to sign a mountain of executive orders in the opening hours of his presidency.</p>

      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Such moves are common practice for incoming administrations looking to make their mark, even if those orders are muted by congressional or legal challenges.</p>

      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">But with nearly 60 day-one promises and up to 100 executive orders expected, Trump’s workload as he re-enters the White House is set to be particularly hefty.</p>
      
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">One Republican senator, John Barrasso, has already predicted a “blizzard” of executive orders, designed to “shock and awe”.</p>

      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Here are some of the most consequential day-one promises Trump has made.</p>
      
      <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-xl py-2 max-w-4xl font-semibold">Mass deportations</h2>
      
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Immigration – and reducing irregular crossings at the southern border – turned out to be one of the leading issues in Trump’s re-election campaign.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">On November 4, just days before he won the presidency, Trump reiterated a pledge he made multiple times on the campaign trail: “On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in American history. We’re going to get them out. We have to.”</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Details of how Trump would undertake – and fund – such a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/trump-lays-out-agenda-including-mass-deportations-in-tv-interview" class="underline decoration-blue-500 text-blue-500">massive operation</a> remain elusive.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">The US government estimates nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the country, though Trump has said he would “declare a national emergency and will use military assets”.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Whom Trump might target is also ambiguous. Some supporters have argued that all individuals in the country without legal papers are “criminals”. Others hope Trump will limit the “mass deportation” effort to those convicted of crimes like theft or assault.</p>
      
      <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-xl py-2 max-w-4xl font-semibold">‘Muslim ban’</h2>
      
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Another one of his first-day pledges is a throwback to his first term in office, when he signed a 2017 executive order that became known as the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/2/1/trumps-expanded-travel-ban-which-countries-are-affected" class="underline decoration-blue-500 text-blue-500">“Muslim ban“</a>.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">It restricted entry for travellers seeking to come to the US from several Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, Libya, Yemen and Sudan. The ban faced an avalanche of legal challenges and was ultimately nixed under President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">But during his new term, Trump has pledged to reinstate the ban as well as “suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country”.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">“We will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,” he told Republican donors in Washington, DC, in September.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">“Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world because I didn’t want to have people ripping down and burning our shopping centres and killing people.”</p>
      
      <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-xl py-2 max-w-4xl font-semibold">Restricting citizenship</h2>
   
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">One executive order Trump is considering for his first day back in the White House would seek to restrict who is eligible for US citizenship.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">The plan has been long in the making. As far back as May 2023, Trump posted a video to his campaign website, outlining his intentions.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">“On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that, under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,” Trump said.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, anyone born inside of the country becomes a citizen, regardless of their parent’s status.</p>
      
      <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-xl py-2 max-w-4xl font-semibold">Bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end</h2>
      
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Trump has repeatedly maintained that the wars in Ukraine and Gaza would never have erupted under his watch.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">While a ceasefire deal to halt Israel’s devastating campaign in Gaza was reached just days before Trump’s inauguration, fighting continues in Ukraine, where Russia launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Trump has pledged to bring that conflict to a swift end during his second term. During a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said the war would be “absolutely over” within “24 hours” of him taking office.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Trump has been more circumspect lately, as his second term approaches. Still, on January 13, he announced he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin “very quickly” upon taking office.</p>
      <p class="sm:text-xl text-base py-2 max-w-4xl">Trump’s team has indicated he will heap pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make a deal happen, prompting concerns that could spell concessions to Moscow.</p>
